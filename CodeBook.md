Variables 
=================

subject: the volunteer who performs the acitivy. There are 30 volunteers. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

activity: activities performed by each subject. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING. 

For different activities, a set of variables were measured, using signal from accelermeter or Gyroscope. The signal can either be time domian or frequency domain signal. So variables are nameed according to their signal types. In addition, the variables are seprated into body and gravity signals.

Also,the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm. Those variables are indicated by Jerk or Magnitude

The average of the mean values and the average of the standard deviations of each individal's each activity's measurements are presented in this dataset.

The signal are 3 dimensial. The measurements can be in X,Y or Z direction. 

-in X direction
